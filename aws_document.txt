what is aws
===========
Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

why we use aws
==============

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow. Running web and application servers in the cloud to host dynamic websites.

advantages of aws
=================

Amazon Web Service provide you with the security you need at a lower cost than in an on-premises environment. AWS provides security and also helps to protect the privacy as it is stored in AWS data centres. AWS infrastructure is designed to keep your data safe no matter what size of your data is.

Disadvantages of using AWS.
==========================

    AWS service limits an they are set by the platform.
    Technology limitations.
    Bigger learning curve.
    High Technical support fee.
    General security concerns.


Cloud on-Demand
===============
Featured snippet from the web
On-demand computing is a delivery model in which computing resources are made available to the user as needed. The resources may be maintained within the user's enterprise, or made available by a cloud service provider.

Application programming interface
=================================

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.


IAM  - identity access management 
===============================

1.what is iam

Aws identity and access management is secure web service it's securely control access to aws resources for users. we an access aws resources using authentication

2.why we need iam

To craete user, manages user and control aws resources using policies and roles

3.components of iam

user, group, roles, policies

4.multifactor authendication

using google authenticator we get one time password for account login

5. hands-on


users
======

using IAM we can create and manage aws user, use permission to allow and deny access aws resources

groups:
======
whenever you create user combined by group uers and policies applied to that group

roles
=====

roles set of policies role assign to application

policies:
========
policies nothing but permission whatever role user and group created, we can apply that policies to user group role.



aws fundamentals:
=================

IAM
1. USER
2. GROUP
3. ROLE
4. Policies

important
=========
EC2 ==> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud forms a central part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services, by allowing users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications

An EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. AWS is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform; EC2 is a service that allows business subscribers to run application programs in the computing environment


Aws regions
===========
1.aws has regions all round the world ex:(us-east-1)
2.Each region has avilability zones ex:(us-east-1a,us-east-1b and so on) up to six availability zones
3.each availabilty zones have physical datacentres every one seperated each other
4. Each avilability zones have minimum 3 datacentres thats basic how aws works 
5. IAM and s3 not require regions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IAM Apr 30 2020
===============  

Identity and access management

1. your whole aws security is there
  . user
  . group
  . roles
2. root account should never be shared
3. user must be created with proper permissions
4. iam is center of aws
5. policies written in json (javascript object notation) 

    
users
=====
. user is pysical person like you or me

groups
======
. users can be grouped together like admin devops and devlopers overall group conatin user
. we can apply permission to group and access aws resources

roles
=====
. roles are internal usages with aws resources and services

policies
=======
. policies are json document
. policies define above all threes what can do and can't do

global view
==========
iam is global role when we create user group role it will avilable all regions

MFA
===
. multifactor authendication can be done with aws

. aws comes with predefined managed policies


what is Ec2
===========

. Ec2 Most popular aws offering

mainly consist of
  . rental virtual machines (Ec2)
  . storing data on virtual drives(EBS)
  . Disribting load across machines(ELB)
  . scaling serivices using auto scaling groups (ASG)

Knowing Ec2 is fundamentals how cloud works

Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
================================
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. ... EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance that is in the same Availability Zone.  


Elastic Load Balancing(ELB)
==========================
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.


AWS Auto Scaling(ASG)
=====================
AWS Auto Scaling is a service that automatically monitors and adjusts compute resources to maintain performance for applications hosted in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud. ... As demand spikes, the AWS Auto Scaling service can automatically scale those resources, and, as demand drops, scale them back down.





Amazon Machine Image(AMI)
====================
Description
An Amazon Machine Image is a special type of virtual appliance that is used to create a virtual machine within the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. It serves as the basic unit of deployment for services delivered using EC2



security groups
===============
2. security groups act as a firewall on Ec2 instances
1. They regulates
   . Access ports
   . Authorized ip ranges
   . control of inbound network (from thers to instance)
   . control of outbound network (from instance to others)


Security group diagram:
=====================

Ec2 instance ====> security group1
                      . inbound rule    <=============                   port 22 allowed to my computer
                                                                         port 22 not allowed to other computer

ec2 instance ===> security group2
                      . outbound rule  =================>                Any port Any ip allowed



security group can be attached multible instances

Locked diown to region/vpc combination

it good to mainatain one security group for ssh

if your security group not accessible timed out it's security group issue.

connection refuse error it's application error

All inbound rules blocked by default

All outbound rules authorized by default 




Private network
==============
private IP

In IP networking, a private network is a network that uses private IP address space. Both the IPv4 and the IPv6 specifications define private IP address ranges. These addresses are commonly used for local area networks in residential, office, and enterprise environments


A public IP address is an IP address that can be accessed over the Internet. ... Your public IP address can be found at What is my IP Address page. Private IP address, on the other hand, is used to assign computers within your private space without letting them directly expose to the Internet

Networking has two sort of ips piv4 and ipv6


public ip ==> we can access web directly
=========
 . public ip means machine can be identified on the internet
 . must be unique across whole web
 . can geo located easily

prvate ip ==> we access web via internet gateway
========
  . private ip means machine can be identified by private network only
  . ip must be unique across private network
  . machine connect to www throuh internet gateway

Elastic ips
===========

when you start and stop ec2 instance , it can change it's public ip.

if you need to have fixed public ip for your instance you need elastic ip

basically you can attache one instance at a time

you have  only 5 elastic ips in your account (you can ask aws to increase elastic ip)

overall try to avoid using elastic ip


Ec2 user data
=============

it's possible to bootstrap our instance using ec2 user datascript

bootsrapping means launching commands when machine starts

script only run once at instance first start

Ec2 user data used to auotmate boot task
  installing update
  installing software
any command you install will need sudo rights



Ec2 instant launch types
========================

On-demand instance == short work load predictable pricing

resvered instance == long work loads (>= 1 year)

convertable reserved instance == long work loads and flexible instances

schedule reserved instance == 	launch within time

spot instances == short work loads cheap price, can lose instance

Dedicated instances == no other customer will share your hardware

Dedicated hosts == book entire 	physical server, control instance placement



Ec2-on-demand
============

pay what you use ( billing per second after one minute)

Has highest cost but no upfront payment

no long term commitment

Recommended short-term and uninterupted work loads you can't predict how application behave

Ec2- reserved instances
=======================

up to 75% discount compared to on-demand

pay upfront for long term commitment

Reservation period can 1 to 3 years

reerve spcific instance type ex: c4 xlarge

Ec2-spot instance
=================

upto 90 % discound compered to on demand

bid price get instance 	as log as under price

if others bid high price than you, your instance lost quickly, you will get  two minute warning notification

not greate for critical job or database


Ec2-dedicated 
=============
physical dedicated instance for your use

full contarol for your instance no share

up to 3 years 


vpc virtual private cloud
=========================

 
A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC.


Why VPC is used?
===============
Why should I use Amazon VPC? Amazon VPC enables you to build a virtual network in the AWS cloud - no VPNs, hardware, or physical datacenters required. You can define your own network space, and control how your network and the Amazon EC2 resources inside your network are exposed to the Internet.

what is subnet
==============

A subnet is a logical partition of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments. It is typically used to subdivide large networks into smaller, more efficient subnetworks. ... Each subnet allows its connected devices to communicate with each other, and routers are used to communicate between subnets.

what is route table
===================

A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.


Internet gateway
================

An Internet gateway is a network "node" that connects two different networks that use different protocols (rules) for communicating. ... If you have a Wi-Fi connection at home, your Internet gateway is the modem or modem/router combination that your ISP provides so that you connect to the Internet through their network


NAT Gateway
===========

NAT gateways. You can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.
================================================================================================================================
load balancer
============

Load balancer are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (Ec2 instances)

how load balancer works
======================

. user connect load balancer and load balancer forward request to backend server.
. instance give response to load balancer and load balancer give response to user

 

why we use load balancer
========================

. spread the load to multiple instances
. expose sing point access(DNS) to your application
. it handles instance failures
. do regular health checks
. provide the ssl termination for your websites
. seperate public traffic from private traffic

. ELB ec2 loadbalancer (managed load balancer)
. aws take care upgrade maintenance and high availability





Types of load balancer 
=====================
. classic load balancer old (v1 2009)
. Application load balancer(v2 2016)
. Network load balancer(v2 2017) 

Health checks
=============
. health checks important for loadbalancer
. loadbalancer forward traffic to available instances
. response not 200 ok then instance is unhealthy


Application load balancer
========================
. layer 7 
. load balancing into multiple httpd applications across machines
. loadbalancing based in route in url
. loadbalancing based on hostname in url
. AlB support http and https websockets protocol
. applicatin server don't see client ip directly
. true ip inserted into header x forwarded
. port mapping feature load balancer can redirect any dynamic port


Network loadbalancer  layer4
===========================
. forward tcp traffic to network load balancer
.  handles millions of request per second
. support for static ip or elastic ip 
. network load balancer choose for extreme load balancer


Auto Scaling group
==================

An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies.


Why do we use auto scaling?
==========================
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. ... If you specify scaling policies, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can launch or terminate instances as demand on your application increases or decreases.

How Auto scaling groups works
=============================

If any instance becomes unhealthy, the auto-scaling group terminates the unhealthy instance and launches another instance to replace it. Using scaling policies you can increase or decrease the number of running EC2 instances in the group automatically to meet the changing conditions.

=========================================================================

Amazon Elastic Block Store EBS(10.05.2020)
==========================================

Amazon Elastic Block Store EBS is a block storage system used to store persistent data. Amazon EBS is suitable for EC2 instances by providing highly available block level storage volumes. It has three types of volume, i.e. General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic.

Kindle. RSS. An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to one instance or to multiple instances at the same time. You can use EBS volumes as primary storage for data that requires frequent updates, such as the system drive for an instance or storage for a database application.

. EBS volume is network drive we can attach drive while instance run
. it's network drive (not a phtsical drive)
. EBS volume locked by availability zone (we canit attache another avilabilty zone ebs volume)
. you can increase the size of the EBS volume 

EBS volume types
===============

. GP2 Genwral Purpose SSD volume that balanced price perpormance for wide work loads
.  IO1 SSD Highest perpormance ssd for mission critical low performance and work loads
.  SD1 	(HDD) low cost HDD volume desined frequently accessed intensive work loads
.  SCI lowest cost HDD less frequently accessed HDD
.  EBS volume characterized by size/throuhput/IOPS


EBS snapshot
===========
. EBS volume can backed up using snapshot
. snapshot only take actual space of EBS volume
. only used data only stored in snapshot


Instance store
==============

. instance store not come with root ebs volume
. they come with instance stor
. instnce store physical ayyached with store
. can't resize 
. on termination instance store will lost
. backup must be operated by user

=================================================================


Route53 in aws(10.05.2020)
==========================

Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System service. Released on December 5, 2010, it is part of Amazon.com's cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services. The name is a reference to TCP or UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed

What is the use of Route 53?
============================

Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.


. Route53 is managed DNS

. DNS is collection rules and records whick helps client understand how to reach server throuh url

AWS most common records
======================

A record:  Urls to ip's  ipv4

AAA record for ipv6

CNAME url to url

ALIAS url to aws resources

Route53 have advances feature
============================
. Load balancing (through dns also called client load balancing)
. Health checks  (althouh limited)
. Routing policy simple failover geolocation geoproximity  

. prefer alias over cname



A Records
=========
A Records. DNS records are used to control the location of a resource on the Internet. As an example, an A Record is used to point a logical domain name, such as "google.com", to the IP address of Google's hosting server, "74.125. ... They also point localhost.example.com to the server that the domain is hosted on.


CNAME
=====
A CNAME, or Canonical Name record, is a record that points to another domain address rather than an IP address. For example, say you have several subdomains, like www.mydomain.com, ftp.mydomain.com, mail.mydomain.com etc and you want these sub domains to point to your main domain name mydomain.com.

ALIAS record
============
An ALIAS record is a virtual host record type which is used to point one domain name to another one, almost the same as a CNAME. The important difference is that ALIAS can coexist with other records on that name.


Amazon Route 53 alias records provide a Route 53–specific extension to DNS functionality. Alias records let you route traffic to selected AWS resources, such as CloudFront distributions and Amazon S3 buckets. They also let you route traffic from one record in a hosted zone to another record.


RDS(Relational database service)15.05.2020
==========================================

. RDS it's managed DB service
. it allow to crete databases in cloud and managed by aws
. Database list
    . postgres
    . oracle
    . mysql, mariadb
    . Microsoft sql server
    . Aurora (Aws propertery service) 	

Advantages on RDS db on EC2 
---------------------------
. managed service
. Os patching level
. continuous backup and restore in specific timestamp
. monitoring dashboards
. Multi availability zone for disaster avaiability
. Maintenance window for upgrades
. scaling windows


disadvantages
-------------
. we can't ssh into rds instance

read replica for scalability
---------------------------
. up to 5 read replicas
. within az or cross az

RDS security
-----------
. RDS database deployed within private subnet
. not in a public
. Rds database works levearge security groups like ec2 instance
. IAM policy help wo can manage RDS



Elastic cache overview(16.05.2020)
=================================

Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory data store and cache service by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The service improves the performance of web applications by retrieving information from managed in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.


How does AWS ElastiCache work
Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy and run Memcached or Redis protocol-compliant server nodes in the cloud. ... Using Amazon ElastiCache, you can not only improve load and response times to user actions and queries, but also reduce the cost associated with scaling web applications.


What is difference between stateless and stateful protocol
Stateless Protocol does not require the server to retain the server information or session details. Stateful Protocol require server to save the status and session information. In Stateless Protocol, there is no tight dependency between server and client. ... Stateless Protocols handle the transaction very fastly.


. Elastic cache get to Managed redis and memcached
. caches are inmemory databases and high performance and low latency
. Help reduce load of worloads for read intensive work loads
. make your application stateless
. write scaling using sharding
. read scaling using read replicas
. multi az for failover

two methos
---------
- redis
- memcached

redis
-----
. redis in-memory key value store
. cache surive reboot by default
. low latency
. stored user sessions


memcached
---------
. memcahed in-memory object store
. cache doesn't survive on reboots
. quick retrival of object from memeory

==================================================================================
Amazon s3(21.05.1990)
=====================

Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.


How does s3 work internally

S3 involves users creating 'buckets'. These buckets are used to store objects. An object consists of data, key(assigned name) and metadata. When data is added to the bucket, Amazon S3 creates a unique version ID and allocates it to the object.


The S3 cloud storage service gives a subscriber access to the same systems that Amazon uses to run its own websites. S3 enables customers to upload, store and download practically any file or object that is up to five terabytes (TB) in size, with the largest single upload capped at five gigabytes (GB).



Amazon s3 bucket
----------------
. Amazon s3 allow people store objects in buckets
. bucket must have globally unique name
. buckets are defined at region level
. nameing convention
   . no upper case 
   . no lower case
   . 3-63 char long
   . not an ip
   . must start with lowercase

s3 object
---------
. s3 object is (file) have key, key is full path
. max size i 5TB
. uplaod more than 5GB use multipart upload
. Metadata list of key and value pair
. Tags used for security and life cycle
. version id is enabled

------------------------------------------------------------------

Aws s3 versioning
=================

. you can versioning aws s3 files
. it's enabled bucket level
. we can protect unintended deleted file
. easy rollback previous verions
--------------------------------------------------------

s3 Encryption
=============

4 types of s3 encryption
------------------------
. SSE-S3 Encrypt s3 object using key handled by aws
. SSE-KMS leverage aws key Managed service and Managed by encryption
. SSE-C when you want to Manage own encryption key
. client side encryption
. xmz-server-side-encryption-AES256
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

S3 security
-----------

2 types
-------

1. user based

.IAM  polices - which API calls should allowed for specific user from IAM console
 
2. resource based

. bucket policies bucket wide rues from s3 console - allow cross account

s3 bucket policies
-----------------
. json based policies
   . resource bucket and objects
   . Actions set of api allow or deny
   . Effect Allow/Deny
   . Princple The account user apply to the policy to

use s3 bucket for policy to
  . grant public access to bucket
  . force object to be encrypted at upload
  . grant access to another account

. Networking
. Logging and Audit
. user security
---------------------------------------------

s3 websites
-----------

. s3 can host static websites and accessible via www
. if you get 403 forbidden error make sure bucket policy allow public read

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

aws cli
=======

AWS CLI is a tool that pulls all the AWS services together in one central console, giving you easy control of multiple AWS services with a single tool. The acronym stands for Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface because, as its name suggests, users operate it from the command line.

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is for managing your AWS services from a terminal session on your own client, allowing you to control and configure multiple AWS services. ... With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is elastic beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications. Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.

Elastic Beanstalk supports applications developed in Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. When you deploy your application, Elastic Beanstalk builds the selected supported platform version and provisions one or more AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, to run your application


What is Elastic Beanstalk used for

Elastic Beanstalk employs Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing to scale and balance workloads. It provides tools in the form of Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the health of deployed applications. It also provides capacity provisioning due to its reliance on AWS S3 and EC2



Advantages. Elastic Beanstalk's main benefits include timesaving server configuration, powerful customization, and a cost-effective price point. Elastic Beanstalk automates the setup, configuration, and provisioning of other AWS services like EC2, RDS, and Elastic Load Balancing to create a web service


Drawbacks. Some of the biggest pains with Elastic Beanstalk include unreliable deployments, lack of transparency and documentation around stack and application upgrades, and an overall lack of clear documentation
